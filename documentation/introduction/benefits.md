## Benefits of using the Open Education API (OOAPI)

Using the Open Education API (OOAPI) delivers clear efficiency gains for
organisations as well as tangible improvements to the student journey.
By working with a shared, open standard, institutions can innovate
faster while offering students a more coherent digital experience.

### Benefits for students and their educational journey

By incorporating the OOAPI into the IT landscape, students can easily:

- Use a smartphone to find the nearest available computer
- Check the status of their study credits via an app
- Register online for courses or exams
- View class timetables on a smartphone
- Securely access exam results
- And much more

To protect personal data such as exam results and timetables, it is
recommended to use an authorisation server that supports OAuth 2.0, in
combination with SURFconext. These security measures are not part of the
OOAPI itself, but their use is strongly advised.
