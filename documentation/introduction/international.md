## Dutch roots

The Open Education API (OOAPI) has its roots in the Netherlands and was
created to support a more flexible educational application landscape.
As an open standard, the OOAPI can be used internationally.

The standard is based on the English language.
English is the official working language used in the GitHub repositories.

## International perspective

The technical working group and SURF actively follow developments in
European and international standards. Alignment at European and
international level is important, as new developments help move the
educational landscape forward.

At present, European initiatives such as Erasmus Without Papers+ and
the ECTS Course Catalogue are important drivers for the development of
the OOAPI.

We see the OOAPI being used increasingly at international level.
Several European university alliances already make use of the OOAPI:

- Enlight uses the OOAPI internally
- UNITA has mapped its course catalogue to the OOAPI
- Aurora is investigating the possibilities of using the OOAPI

governance model is currently being developed.

outside the Netherlands.
